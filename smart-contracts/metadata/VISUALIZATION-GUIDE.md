1. Continuous rotation of core geometry
2. Frequency wave emission (pulsing)
3. Aetheric biot particle streams
4. I AM Code ripple propagation
5. Quantum entanglement connections (if applicable)
6. Dimensional portal effects
7. Network override visualization

### Technical Specifications

#### Image Dimensions
- **Static**: 3000x3000px minimum (square)
- **Animation**: 1920x1080px, 60fps, 15-60 seconds loop
- **Format**: PNG for static, MP4/WebM for animation

#### Particle Systems
- **Count**: 1000-10000 particles
- **Emission**: Continuous with burst effects
- **Lifetime**: 5-10 seconds per particle
- **Physics**: Zero gravity, outward velocity
